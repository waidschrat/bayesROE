Description: Computation and visualization of Bayesian Regions of Evidence to 
    systematically evaluate the sensitivity of a superiority or non-inferiority 
    claim against any prior assumption of its assessors. Methodological details 
    are elaborated by Hoefler and Miller (<https://osf.io/jxnsv>). 
    Besides generic functions, the package also provides an intuitive 'Shiny' 
    application, that can be run in local R environments.
